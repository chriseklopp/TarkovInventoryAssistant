Motivation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Escape from Tarkov doesn't have a method of itemizing your hideout Stash (item storage). The only useful information the
game gives you is your total stash value to the Traders. It can be a pain to keep track of what items you have, need, or 
should sell to the Traders or on the flea market. This tool to itemize an
inventory into a readable list (and potentially other functions) will make inventory management a lot easier and less of
a headache.
